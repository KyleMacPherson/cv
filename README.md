## Kyle MacPherson

Junior web developer/software engineer with a love for data, statistics and getting things done! Successful eight year career as a profesisonal poker player ([see me on TV!](https://youtu.be/pkXecSRDZ9s?t=1037)) and currently a pupil in all things object-oriented. Studied code at Makers Academy and fell in love with software programming and design. Presently I'm looking to begin my new career in an environment with equally passionate individuals where I can continue to learn fast amongst a team and return value quickly.

## Code examples:

## Skills

#### Self-led learner

I completed the 12-week full-time curriculum at the Makers Academy bootcamp filled with intense pair-programming and exposure to theory and best practice during the week, and solo real-world challenges every weekend. This gave us a compact introduction to test-driven development and forces us to be agile, value teamwork and learn new tech quick.

Completed every challenge, using Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, AngularJS, HTML, CSS and more, all test-driven by user stories.

Learned to love Git. Very comfortable with using git to manage different features of a product under development. I know how to use branching git workflow, reverting in git and handling merge conflicts.

Enjoyed learning about concepts and technologies outside of the scope of the Makers curriculum; working with both ionic and meteor to create mobile apps and becoming especially interested in creating and working with API's, particularly in Rails, but also using Sinatra and Express.

#### Team player

As a Makers Academy graduate I have spent a lot of time pair programming as well as working in small teams. My favourite periods of the course were the final weeks during which I have been part of a teams producing MVPs to a deadline. I find these kind of high pressure situations extremely exciting, and have found that this is where I have done my best work, and progressed the fastest. I have also found that understanding the thought processes of others, as well as having to explain my own, has been an invaluable learning tool.
