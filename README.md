Kyle MacPherson

I'm a Makers Academy graduate who loves having coding problems to puzzle over and solve. I'm seeking a working environment that is strongly conducive to learning new skills, ideally with a group of enthusiastic developers allowing me to hone my craft and take my skill set to the next level.

Skills
Test Driven Development

As a Makers Academy graduate I place a strong emphasis on writing well tested code. I develop all my applications from user specifications, using these to write feature tests. I then build up to passing the feature tests with unit tests. This ensure that I deliver a high quality, easy to maintain code base that meets the specifications without adding unnecessary undocumented features. Full test coverage also enables me to refactor any code I have written while remaining assured that refactoring doesn’t break any features. Example of test coverage:

Ruby on Rails example:

AngularJS example:

Object Oriented Design

I write clean code, comprised of single responsibility classes. This allows for reuse of features, easier reading, easier unit testing and easier extension and modification. I adhere to S.O.L.I.D principles when writing code and always write DRY code.

example:



Pair Programming and Working in teams.

As a Makers Academy graduate I have spent a lot of time pair programming and working in teams between 4 and 6 strong to produce MVPs under a deadline. I love pair programming as I find it very efficient. Having two heads to bounce ideas off and explaining my thought processes out loud really helps with developing a product.

Git version control

I have worked extensively with git and am very comfortable with using git to manage different features of a product under development. I know how to use branching git workflow, reverting in git and handeling merge conflicts.

My Github:

Unix environments

I do all my development from the command line (Mac Bash shell). I’m very comfortable working in this environment, even more so than in Finder!

Databases

I’ve worked with PSQL through ORMs such as DataMapper and ActiveRecord. I’ve also worked with the NoSQL database MongoDB. I can also issue raw SQL commands from the command line.

Web Development

I’m very comfortable working and developing RESTful APIs. I’ve worked a lot with get and post requests in Ruby and JavaScript.
Example:

I’m confident writing and running my own servers, and deploying apps to Heroku. I’ve also worked with Amazon Web Services and know how to keep sensitive data in environment variables rather than pushing it to github!

Agile Development

I’m a big fan of the agile development process. I’ve been part of and also run twice daily standups/scrums. I start projects by identifying the minimum viable product, building that in a modular extensible fashion and only adding features when requested by the client. I’ve used kanban boards, particularly waffle.io (as it tracks with git issues) to manage the work load in teams working to develop a product.
Example:

Communication

During my time at Makers Academy I gained a reputation for being able to communicate ideas and programming concepts clearly to my fellow students. I’ve given a joint lecture on how to think about a particularly difficult coding problem to the juniors on the course and I’ve spent time sitting with students who were struggling and explained to them the concepts they were having difficulty with. I’m currently mentoring a friend who is interested in web development and applying to join Makers Academy.
